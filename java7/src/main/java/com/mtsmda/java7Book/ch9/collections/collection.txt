Collections come in four basic flavors:
■ Lists Lists of things (classes that implement List)
■ Sets Unique things (classes that implement Set)
■ Maps Things with a unique ID (classes that implement Map)
■ Queues Things arranged by the order in which they are to be processed

Principal features of non-primary implementations:

    HashMap has slightly better performance than LinkedHashMap, but its iteration order is undefined
    HashSet has slightly better performance than LinkedHashSet, but its iteration order is undefined
    TreeSet is ordered and sorted, but slower
    TreeMap is ordered and sorted, but slower
    LinkedList has fast adding to the start of the list, and fast deletion from the interior via iteration
